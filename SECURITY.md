## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Motionext seriously. If you have discovered a security vulnerability in our application, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please send an email to [security@motionext.app](mailto:security@motionext.com). You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or page)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

We request that you contact us via the email address above and give the project contributors a chance to resolve the vulnerability and issue a new release prior to any public exposure; this helps protect Motionext users from discovered vulnerabilities until they can be fixed.

## Security Measures

Motionext implements several security measures to protect user data and ensure the integrity of the application:

1. **Data Encryption**: All sensitive user data is encrypted both in transit and at rest.
2. **Authentication**: We use secure authentication methods to protect user accounts.
3. **Regular Updates**: We regularly update our dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
4. **Code Reviews**: All code changes undergo thorough review before being merged into the main branch.
5. **Third-party Security Audits**: We periodically engage third-party security experts to audit our application.

## Commitment to Security

The Motionext team is committed to responding quickly to any potential security issues and will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix or release.

Thank you for helping to keep Motionext and our users safe!
